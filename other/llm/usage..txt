how to show summary summary(data$average_playtime) as a table 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To display the summary of the response variable as a table in R, you can use the knitr::kable() function or gt to format the summary statistics into a table.

Example using kable():
r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

# Create summary statistics for the response variable 'average_playtime'
summary_table <- data %>%
  summarise(
    Mean = mean(average_playtime, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median = median(average_playtime, na.rm = TRUE),
    Std_Dev = sd(average_playtime, na.rm = TRUE),
    Min = min(average_playtime, na.rm = TRUE),
    Max = max(average_playtime, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Display the summary table using kable
kable(summary_table, caption = "Summary of Average Playtime")
Example using gt:
r
Copy code
library(gt)

# Display the summary table using gt
summary_table %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(title = "Summary of Average Playtime")
This will format the summary of the response variable into a clean, readable table for your output.
